# Ring MQTT Hass.io Addon
This addon provides integration of Ring devices into Hass.io using the [ring-mqtt](https://github.com/xversial/ring-mqtt) script.  Currently most alarm devices are supported, as well as camera functions.  Camera support is disabled by default since these are supported via native Ring component in Home Assistant, but can be enabled if you prefer to use the support here.

***This add-on requires an MQTT broker.  The Mosquitto plugin for Hass.io is highly recommended, but any MQTT compliant broker should work.***

### Configuration
***Ring now requires two-factor authentication (2FA) so the username and password options have been removed from this addon.***
***Please read the instruction below to generate a refresh token.***

To simplify generation of a 2FA refresh token the ring-mqtt script and this addon have been enhanced to include a small web service.  To activate this service simply leave the "refresh_token" field blank and start the addon and watch the logs for the following message:

No refresh token found, go to http://<ip_address>:55123/

You can access this URL manually, or simply click the "OPEN WEB UI" button on the addon page.  This will access a simple form that will accept your Ring username/password and then the 2FA code sent via email/text.  Once you enter these it will present the refresh token and the webserver/addon will stop within 10 seconds.  Simple copy this token and paste it into the ring_token option of the config (yes, it's LONG).  Now start the addon again and it will attempt to login with the refresh token.

For security purposes the webserver runs only if the ring_token option is blank so it's not reachable under normal operation, although the "OPEN WEB UI" option will still be in the addon UI it will not function.  If you need to regenerate the refresh token simply delete the existing token from the config options and restart the script.

To configure this plugin please review the following options:

| Config Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| host | This plugin is configured to run on the host network so localhost should be fine if running Mosquitto on the Hass.io server |
| port | MQTT broker port, default is 1883, rarely needs to be changed |
| ring_topic | Top level MQTT topic where ring devices will be published.  Should rarely be changed.  |
| hass_topic | The default Hass.io availability topic, used to monitor for Hass.io restarts to republish device state.  Should rarely be changed. |
| mqtt_user | Username for MQTT broker (default for Mosquitto addon is to use HA username/password) |
| mqtt_pass | Password for MQTT broker (default for Mosquitto addon is to use HA username/password) |
| ring_token | The refresh token received after authenticating with 2FA - See https://github.com/dgreif/ring/wiki/Two-Factor-Auth |
| enable_cameras | Default false since the native Ring component for Home Assistant supports these, set to true to use camera support in this addon |
| location_ids | Comma separated list of location Ids to limit devices.  Blank is all locations which the specified account has access to. |
